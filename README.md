# RouteFinder.WebApp

Hi guys! Thank you in advance for spending the time to check out my repo.

[RouteFinder.API GitHub repo](https://github.com/Kosta-Kai-Ugrina/RouteFinder.API)

## Website URL

The website can se be found [here](https://lively-sky-028740303.5.azurestaticapps.net).

If the link doesn't work, try copy-pasting this URL into your browser:

If that doesn't work

## Local startup

Without my intervention, it's impossible to get results from the Google API because I've restricted the API keys. So a local startup won't bear much fruit functionality-wise (the search box and map won't load and you won't be able to find any routes), but you can still run the app with `npm start`.
